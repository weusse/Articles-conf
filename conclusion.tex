\section{Conclusion}\label{conclusion}
In this study, six ML models have been extensively tested and compared over various datasets in order to evaluate their performance for the task of predicting Malaria occurrence in a patient knowing his signs and symptoms. The results obtained show that some of them are promising and overcome RDT in particular settings. As future work, we plan to study the implementation of an ensemble method for predicting Malaria occurrence built on the algorithms offering the best performances in our present study.
